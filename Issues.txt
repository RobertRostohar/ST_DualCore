CMSIS Project Manager:
 - "packs" can be specified on solution but not on project or layer
 - how to specify a linker script?
   - as file with .sct extension: seems to work
   - "linker" not supported by schema
 - how to specify?
   - floating point type
   - secure/non-secure

Solution convert:
 - pack without version gets a fixed version
 - issues with .gpdsc when output directory is specified
   - gpdsc not copied
   - files reference in gpdsc not copied

Solution generator:
 - workflow:
   - generate cprj -> component with generator
     - error gpdsc cannot be read since it does not yet exists
   - launch generator for context with cprj
 - STM32CubeMX launcher: cannot handle filename.Debug+CM4

uVision .cprj import:
 - linker file not shown in project view
 - board settings not used for debugger
   - board: STM32H747I-EVAL
   - device: STM32H747XIHx:CM4 or STM32H747XIHx:CM7
